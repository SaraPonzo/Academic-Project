###  Abstract
This project studies ENI’s daily return volatility over 2010–2024 by comparing **GARCH-family** models (sGARCH, EGARCH, GJR) with **Stochastic Volatility (SV)** specifications (including leverage and heavy-tailed). Using log returns, we estimate each model and generate one-step-ahead volatility forecasts. Performance is evaluated via **AIC**, **RMSE** against a realized-volatility proxy, and **risk backtesting** (VaR/ES). We also apply **changepoint detection (PELT)** to identify volatility clusters and use **Extreme Value Theory (GEV)** on monthly maxima/minima to characterize tail risk.
